=head1 NAME

RT::Extension::TicketActions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides easy access to frequently used ticket actions.

Also so called "follow-up" actions set the ticket status to `stalled` and add a relative due date with a fixed time.
This means that a ticket should be due in x days. This combination of properties can be used in searches or escalations
to bring tickets up to users. In addition holidays of a specific country and specific days of week can be skipped
automatically, if enabled.

In addition to that, this extension provides navigation items if you have opened this ticket from a search result
listing. You can navigate between search result tickets (first, previous, next, last), open the search result list
again or even modify the search query.
